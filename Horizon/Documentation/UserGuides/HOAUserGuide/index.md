## What is a Reserve Study?

A reserve study is a financial planning document that helps your community prepare for future repair and replacement costs of major components like roofs, pools, parking lots, and other shared assets. It includes:

- **Component Inventory** - A list of all major assets in your community
- **Condition Assessment** - Current state and remaining useful life of each component
- **Funding Plan** - A strategy to build adequate reserves over time
