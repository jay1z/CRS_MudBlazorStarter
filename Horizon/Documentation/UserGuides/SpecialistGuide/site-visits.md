|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Excellent** | Like new, no issues | 80-100% of useful life |
| **Good** | Normal wear, well maintained | 50-80% of useful life |
| **Fair** | Visible wear, needs attention soon | 20-50% of useful life |
| **Poor** | Significant deterioration | 0-20% of useful life |
| **Failed** | Non-functional or unsafe | Needs immediate action |
