                        Community Reserve Specialists uses real time local costs from years of relationships with local contractors and vendors currently serving Communities throughout Ohio. Local and real time data helps ensure the most accurate financial projections vs the National "templates" used by many other, non-local Reserve Study providers. Having real-time local data ensures the highest level of accuracy.

In order for the Board to comply with these statutes, it must have a complete list of Community Assets, know/obtain their current replacement values for short term expected expenditures, and project long term expected expenditures to ensure an accurate plan going forward. Per Ohio Law, the Board is not required to obtain a firm to provide a Reserve Study (NEW: see next bullet point), however, most reputable Law Firms familiar with Association Law will strongly recommend the Board hire a properly credentialed and qualified specialist to provide a Reserve Study." },
        new BulletPoint() { Text = "As of September 2023, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now require Boards to hire a professional provider (R.S., P.R.A., or C.P.A. who specializes in Reserve Studies) to perform the Reserve Study in order to qualify for approval. The Association must also maintain a \"Fully Funding\" status by following the recommended contributions each year, and the study must be no older than 36 months. Fannie and Freddie own approximately 70% of the paper (loans) currently servicing Condominium Owners and Homeowners throughout the U.S. They will now require documentation from the loan originators to ensure these standards are met. If the Board/Manager cannot provide the required documents, Loan Originators may not be able to sell the loan and therefore may decline funding to applicants trying to purchase within the unqualified Communities. This can obviously effect property values and potentially drop otherwise qualified buyers from being able to purchase within these Communities." },

(National Reserve Study Standards) require  a Reserve Study contain not only the information required by the State of Ohio, but also additional information and data (that may meet other state statutes) as these are National Standards. These additional Reserve Study standards are a basic reason the term \"Reserve Study\" is not used within the Ohio Revised Code." },
        new BulletPoint() { Text = "A Reserve Study is a financial report, not an engineering report. The Board/Managers do not need to know how to install the components within the Community or how they are designed. The goal of the study should be to financially prepare each Board/Manager with data that reflects real time local costs and accurate actual useful life projections from a local historical database right here in Ohio, not nationally averaged numbers. Ohio Law requires Boards collect and maintain funds sufficient to replace/repair capital elements without the need for special assessments, not to install these components on their own." },
        new BulletPoint() { Text = "A Reserve Study can often be \"Personalized\" to fit the unique needs of the Community. Many times we find Communities have folks on a fixed income and fear increasing the fees to meet the fully funding requirements. We can implement custom planning that allows for maximum considerations given to these folks without jeopardizing Community property values." },

CRS very rarely is underbid, but if we are, we will do our best to work with a Community/Manager should they wish to work with us. Per the CAI and APRA websites, there is no other individual with both credentials (R.S. and P.R.A.) residing in the State of Ohio, Jeff appears to be the only one. We have performed hundreds and hundreds of Reserve Studies in the State of Ohio, it's all we do. We are located in Northeast Ohio, this makes it very easy to visit properties without the time constraints, costs, time and expenses of flying, hotels, rental cars etc. when coming in from out of state.  Living in Ohio and building relationships with local contractors gives us real time local costs vs companies using national templates. This ensures the highest level of accuracy in your financial projections." },

We continue to rely solely on word of mouth as we feel it is the best way to continue growing our business as well as keep our, and therefore your costs down. Every dollar counts when it comes out of Community Members pockets." }
