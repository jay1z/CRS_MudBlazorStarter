3. **Type your full name** in the signature field
4. **Enter your title** (e.g., "Board President", "Property Manager")
5. **Check the agreement box** confirming you've read the terms
6. **Click "Accept Proposal"** or **"Sign & Accept"**

### What Happens When You Sign

Your electronic signature is legally equivalent to a handwritten signature under the E-SIGN Act.
