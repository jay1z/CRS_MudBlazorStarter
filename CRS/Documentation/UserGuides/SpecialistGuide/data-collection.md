## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: The client says they submitted, but I don't see it.**
A: Check if they clicked "Submit" or just "Save." Status should be "Submitted" not "In Progress."

**Q: The financial numbers seem unrealistic.**
A: Ask for documentation. Some communities have unusual situations that are legitimate.

**Q: Client can't access the form.**
A: Verify their email. Send a new link. Check if their account is active.

**Q: Documents won't upload.**
A: Check file size and format. Have client try different browser. Submit via email if needed.

**Q: Client is unresponsive.**
A: Try different contact methods. Contact the property manager if different from primary. Escalate to admin.
