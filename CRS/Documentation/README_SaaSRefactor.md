# SaaS Refactor — Assistant Notes

This document holds a concise, assistant-focused summary of the recent automated changes and the minimal follow-ups required after a session reset. Keep it short — its purpose is to allow the assistant to reconstruct relevant context quickly.

## Core changes applied
- Optimistic concurrency added:
 - `TenantHomepage` and `ReserveStudy` include `[Timestamp] public byte[]? RowVersion`.
 - `TenantHomepageService` now supports concurrency-aware save/publish and force-save methods and throws `TenantHomepageConcurrencyException` on conflicts.
- Tenant scoping centralization:
 - `ApplicationDbContext` applies tenant query filters to `ITenantScoped` entities via `ApplyTenantQueryFilters(ModelBuilder)` and skips global tables (Tenants, Settings, AccessTokens, AuditLogs).
 - Indexes added: `AspNetUsers(TenantId)` and unique `TenantHomepage(TenantId)`.
- Visual editor integration:
 - `VisualPageEditor.razor` now uses `TenantHomepageService` for Save/Publish and handles concurrency by prompting Overwrite vs Reload.
- Media & file storage:
 - `FileStorageService` provides per-tenant path helpers. A minimal dev upload controller (`/api/upload`) exists for local testing.

## Practical follow-ups (assistant reminder)
- Migrations: RowVersion and index changes require EF migrations. (User will run these.)
- Editor UX: Autosave + undo/redo not implemented — consider adding when improving editor.
- Upload hardening: Server-side MIME, size validation and virus scanning required for production.
- Tests: Add unit tests for `TenantHomepageService` concurrency flows and integration tests for tenant filters.
